The {{ .Name }} tool is designed to {{ .Description }} in {{ .Environment }} environments using a gadget.
It uses a map of key-value pairs called params to configure its behavior but does not require any specific parameters to function.

The tool can either be run for a specified amount of time by setting the timeout parameter (returning the results afterwards)
or started to be run in the background (set `background` to `true` in that case). When running in the background, the
tool will return a unique identifier (ID) of the newly created gadget instance. This ID can be used when calling
`get-results` and `stop-gadget` to control the corresponding gadget instance. Running a gadget in the background allows
capturing events while running other tasks (like triggering events using other tools) or conversing with the user.

Make sure to always stop gadgets using `stop-gadget` after you are done with them as they will otherwise waste resources
on the host. Also make sure to get the results before calling `stop-gadget`, as the results won't be available anymore
after calling `stop-gadget`.

## Usage
Always ask users questions so that the results can be filtered to a minimum. Here are some examples of questions you can ask:
- Do you want to filter for specific namespace/pod/node?
- Do you want to filter for specific fields?

## Fields
Fields can be filtered using the `operator.filter.filter` param. Format: FIELD (Description) [PossibleValues]:

{{ range $field := .Fields -}}
- {{ $field.Name }}{{ if $field.Description }}({{ $field.Description }}){{ end }}{{ if $field.PossibleValues }}[{{ $field.PossibleValues }}]{{ end }}
{{ end }}
## Output

The tool produces a JSON object as output when not running in the background; review the data and provide a concise summary to the user.
